# C# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in C#. The primary goal of this project is to provide clear and efficient solutions for various coding challenges encountered on LeetCode, focusing on algorithms and data structures. They are intended to be used as a reference for me while I learn C# and prepare for technical interviews. The solutions are based on solutions that I have implemented with JavaScript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
